## Research Interests
The main concept in my research is approaching to complex and chaotic phenomena with mathematical tools, especially **UQ(Uncertainty Quantification)**.
My research interests are mainly in understanding the effectiveness of UQ(Uncertainty Quantification) approach to mathematical fluid dynamics, in which complex and chaotic behaviors of fluid are studied.
I am also interested in interdisciplinary studies, where I would like to connect many researchers in different fields by using mathematics. Since I am good at constructing mathematical models and analyzing data, these skills can help to make progress on study in some fields except mathematics.

### specific themes
- Computing a stationary flow of 2D Euler equation with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
- Creating the fundamental framework of data assimilation with topological data

### keywords
Uncertainty Quantification(UQ), mathematical fluid dynamics, Topological Flow Data Analysis(TFDA), data assimilation, interdisciplinary studies, machine learning, weather forecasting, bio-logging
