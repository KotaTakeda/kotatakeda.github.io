Welcome to Kota Takeda's home page! [Japanese page >>](/)

Assistant Professor, Department of Applied Physics, Graduate School of Engineering, Nagoya University\\
*takeda[at]na.nuap.nagoya-u.ac.jp*


## Research Interests
My research focuses on applying mathematical tools to analyze complex and chaotic phenomena, utilizing both theoretical and numerical methods.
In particular, I'm working on **UQ(Uncertainty Quantification)** approaches to mathematical fluid dynamics.

I am also interested in interdisciplinary studies, where I would like to interact with many researchers in different fields by using mathematics. 
<!-- Since I am good at constructing mathematical models and analyzing data, these skills can help to make progress on study in some fields except mathematics. -->

### Ph.D Thesis
