## Research Interests
My research focuses on applying mathematical tools to analyze complex and chaotic phenomena, utilizing both theoretical and numerical methods.
In particular, I'm working on **UQ(Uncertainty Quantification)** approaches to mathematical fluid dynamics.

I am also interested in interdisciplinary studies, where I would like to interact with many researchers in different fields by using mathematics. 
<!-- Since I am good at constructing mathematical models and analyzing data, these skills can help to make progress on study in some fields except mathematics. -->

### Specific themes
- Computing a stationary flow of 2D Euler equation with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
- Mathematical analysis of data assimilation
- Creating the fundamental framework of data assimilation with topological data

### Keywords
Uncertainty Quantification(UQ), mathematical fluid dynamics, Topological Flow Data Analysis(TFDA), data assimilation, interdisciplinary studies, machine learning, weather forecasting
